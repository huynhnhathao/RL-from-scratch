# Implementation of RL algorithms from scratch with Pytorch


* Each algorithm is in one notebook

* All of them will be implemented using pytorch

All of the algorithms implemented include:

1. VanillaDQN: DQN with no augmentation, please refer to `Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python, Laura Graesser and Wah Loon Keng` for more information.
