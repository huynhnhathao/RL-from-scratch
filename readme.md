# Implementation of RL algorithms from scratch with Pytorch

### I implementing varous RL algorithms from scratch. My implementations may not be the most efficient, but it's pretty easy to read, has plenty of explanatory comments, and user manual. 

* Each algorithm is in one notebook

* All of them will be implemented using pytorch

All of the algorithms implemented include:

1. VanillaDQN: DQN with no augmentation, please refer to `Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python, Laura Graesser and Wah Loon Keng` for more information.
